            <h2>Why use object orientation in C?</h2>
            <p>Object orientation comes with a lot of pros <strong>(and a lot of cons)</strong>, but when used correctly provides maintability, scalability, modularity, extensibility and reusability.</p>
            <p><strong>The C Language</strong>, nowadays, is mostly used for embedded programming in microcontrollers such as esp8266, esp32, arms and many others. </p>
            <p>Most of these environments also allow you to program in <strong>C++</strong>, although many would argue that is not much of an improvement, it still makes things much easier.</p>
            <p>The problem is that these kind of microcontrollers have very limited resources, specially concerning memory. And for them, even the <strong>C++</strong> environments comes with a high cost for your application.</p>
            <p>So using object orientation directly in <strong>C</strong> can help you achieve the benefits of </p>
